Clustering Algorithm with K-means
This repository contains the implementation of a clustering algorithm using Python, specifically focusing on the K-means algorithm. The goal of this project is to find optimal clusters within a given dataset.

Features
Data preprocessing: The code includes data preprocessing steps such as standardization and one-hot encoding for numerical and categorical features, respectively.
Iterative algorithm: An iterative algorithm is implemented to determine the optimal number of clusters. The algorithm utilizes a distance-based threshold to group data points and iteratively adjusts the clusters until convergence.
K-means clustering: The K-means algorithm is applied to further refine the clustering results. It involves initializing cluster centroids, assigning data points to the nearest centroid, and updating the centroids until convergence.
Data visualization: The clustering results are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to two components. The data points are then plotted in a scatter plot, colored according to their assigned cluster labels.
